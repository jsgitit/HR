# Welcome!

Thank you for visiting this app. I’m a Back-End Developer aspiring to be better with Front-End development with Blazor.

This small HR demo app is designed to handle employee information. This is primarily a learning project.

## Key Features:

- **Employee Management:** There's support for CRUD operations for employees.
- **Docker Integration:** The application is containerized using Docker Compose, enabling easy deployment and scalability.
- **Dark Mode Support:** Added dark mode toggle button in the nav bar - implemented with help from ChatGPT. Modified `site.css` and `site.js` to support this.
- **Code-First Database Approach:** The database is created with Code-First approach, and data migrations are applied every time at startup.

Please note that while this application demonstrates foundational functionality, some features are still under development.

## Next Steps:

Assuming you have Docker Desktop installed, you can clone and run the VS2022 solution.
